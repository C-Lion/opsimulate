hints:
  - Using 'tcpdump' on the Gitlab server is a great way to monitor outgoing and incoming traffic of all kinds. You can filter for source and destination ports and ip addresses.
  - Using 'ping' to try and reach the Gitlab server is a great way to see whether the server can resolve any kinds of traffic. But beware, ping uses icmp protocol!
  - Using dns lookup tools like 'dig' or 'nslookup' are great ways to find whether a hostname or IP address is resolvable.
  - Using 'curl' is a great way to get more explicit HTTP info about endpoints.
  - I think someone on the security team mentioned something recently about changing firewall rules on all servers...
  - One of the most commonly utilized Linux utilities for network control is 'iptables'. Super powerful tool!
